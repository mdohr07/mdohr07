## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi there! 👋 I'm Miriam, also known as **mdohr07**, a Frontend Developer with a background in Graphic Design and a love for the Old Web and Indie Web.
I recently completed a Web Development course to level up my skills. Originally trained as a graphic designer, I spent the last decade freelancing as a Concept Artist and Comic Artist. 
Back in 1999, I taught myself HTML and CSS to build static websites. During my studies, I also worked as a Web Designer and my current focus lies in leveling up my Web Dev skills.
