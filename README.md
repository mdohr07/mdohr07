## 👽 About Me

Hi there!
I'm Miriam, also known as **mdohr07** and I am currently retraining to become an IT specialist. Originally trained as a graphic designer, I spent the last decade freelancing as a Concept Designer and Comic Artist. 
Back in 1999, I taught myself HTML and CSS to build static websites. During my studies, I also worked as a Web Designer and I have lots of love for the Old Web and Indie Web.

What you feel, you attract.<br>
What you imagine, you create."<br>

### 🚴‍♀️ Hobbies

Apart from coding, I am enthusiastic about road cycling. Also painting and drawing are still close to my heart, but now more of a hobby.
