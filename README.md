## 👽 About Me

Hi there!
I'm Miriam, also known as **mdohr07** and I am currently retraining to become an IT specialist. Originally trained as a graphic designer, I spent the last decade freelancing as a Concept Designer and Comic Artist. 
Back in 1999, I taught myself HTML and CSS to build static websites. During my studies, I also worked as a Web Designer and I have lots of love for the Old Web and Indie Web.
